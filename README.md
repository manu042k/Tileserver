# Slippy Map Server - Snowmap Interview Assignment
Being a developer at a startup means venturing into the unknown and learning quickly. This assessment is designed to evaluate your problem-solving skills when tackling an unfamiliar challenge.

## Overview
In this assessment, you will implement a simple service to extract map tiles from a geospatial raster dataset and serve them as PNG images. Tiles are generated based on coordinates (```x, y, z```)â€”representing horizontal index, vertical index, and zoom level, respectively. Your solution will process a provided GeoTIFF file and return 256x256 PNG tiles via a local web server. You may use any programming language of your choice.

- [Slippy Map Tile Naming (OpenStreetMap)](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames)

### Provided Resources
- A TIFF file as the source for tile generation: ```snowdepth.tiff```
- A mapbox implementation in ```mapbox/src/App.js``` with an Snowmap tile server

### Objective
1. Create a web service that extracts tiles from ```snowdepth.tiff``` based on tile coordinates(```x, y, z```)
2. Serve the tiles as PNG images over HTTP
3. Run the service on localhost - no deployment is required
4. Replace the tile layer in ```App.js``` with your own implementation

### Expectations
- Your implementation supports dynamic image generation - meaning it works with any given tiff file.
- You are encouraged to use any tools, libraries, or frameworks that help achieve the goal, make sure you includehow  references.
- The final solution should be well-structured and documented.
- You DO NOT need to deploy the server; running it on `localhost` is sufficient

## Getting Started with the enviroment

To set up the mapbox environment we have provided, run the following commands:
```
cd mapbox
npm install
npm start
```

Once the setup completes successfully, a map should appear in your browser. 

Your task is to replace the server that provides tiles on the map with your own localhost server URL.

## Deliverables
### Code Submission:

- Push your implementation to a public GitHub repository.
- Update this ```README.md``` with setup and usage instructions.

### Demo Video:

- Record a short video (screen recording) demonstrating your server in action.
- Upload it to a platform like YouTube (unlisted) or Google Drive and share the link.

### Submit your work:

- Email the GitHub repository link along with the demo video link.
